# Storybook Host

**Storybook** is a tool for developing UI components in isolation, allowing us to test, debug, and showcase components without affecting the main application.

The **Storybook Host** library is a library that provides a centralized location where we can visualize all our component's stories from across the repository.

## Benefits

- **Faster development:** With a Storybook Host library, we can develop, test, and showcase components without having to serve multiple Storybook instances and navigate between them. This results in a faster development process and increased productivity.
