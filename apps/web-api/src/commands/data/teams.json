We see there being many low-hanging fruits there, both in the user-experience and in the privacy realm.\n\nThereafter we'll launch a knowledge-management interface where users can interact with structured data whether that data emerge from conversations with others, brainstorm sessions, meetings, digital reading history or data previously entered in another structure.\n\nThe long-term goal is to create a social knowledge graph where users can score each other and others claims on truthfulness, usefulness and agree on shared values.

The current standard of copyright treatment is outdated.\n\nThat’s why we’ve created SharpShark. How it works\nFirst, authorship is proved and certified with WEB3 standards that are compatible with modern law both in the US and EU. It’s more cost-efficient and faster than using traditional tools.\nSecond, SharpShark tracks copyrighted piece usage, be it text or images.\nThird, in case of violations, pirated copies are addressed with our blockchain evidence-based dispute resolution tool.\nNot only do we protect copyrighted content, but we also help IP holders with monetization by providing a simpler method to buy content with clear terms of usage.\n\nWe’re building a decentralized IP oracle. It’s a neutral source of data to allow anyone to know by whom, when & with what terms of distribution any piece of content on the web was ever created. For creators, it means full IP control with transparent rights transfer & advanced image monitoring feature that prevents image hijacking.\n","Website":"https://www.sharpshark.io","Twitter":"@SharpShark256","Network members":["recTj4SbPQFQDrnkQ","recaASIXgOEY4x6Hu","recEfQ4Zy1WwgQm3U"],"Logo":[{"id":"attJaIcefkUf98Hqf","width":500,"height":500,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1658dc1e55e641ce0b3bddfe3267edd2/0379fda6/LogoIconsquareUV_LV.png","filename":"Logo + Icon, square, UV_LV.png","size":14088,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4a10633e6369508328003ef050dc758e/2063ed17","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/954b72591a42700dcfd6b393936b2dd9/cc00e5f6","width":500,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/184bf0d1e23b5d90cefb139a7ae1482f/851803b2","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Industry":["Blockchain","NFT","Content Moderation"],"Blog":"https://hackernoon.com/u/SharpShark","IPFS User":true,"Funding Stage":"Pre-seed","Accelerator Programs":["Techstars"],"Tags":["recQL48A3uH7QTwA2","recG5w4xYu5ZAgvM9"],"Preferred Method of Contact":"256@SHARPSHARK.IO","Created":"2022-10-18","Metro Area (from Network Member Metro)":["Madrid","Seattle","Valéncia"],"Record ID":"recJzuIRJjAWXH6e6","Number of members":3,"Tags lookup":["NFT","Content Moderation"],"Membership Source":["PL Ventures","Techstars"]}},{"id":"recKAqkSwWVsCChiU","createdTime":"2022-11-10T04:17:23.000Z","fields":{"Name":"CryptoNet","Short description":"CryptoNetLab is an applied cryptography research lab working focusing on improving crypto-networks","Long description":"CryptoNet is a community of researchers and engineers working on designing, proving, improving the building blocks for crypto-networks to engender new capabilities across the Web 3.0 stack. \n\nThe group was founded to drive the creation of Filecoin, but it seeks to facilitate the development and incorporation of cryptographic tools to increase security and privacy of communication more broadly.","Website":"https://cryptonet.org","Network members":["recMKvxJ3us94WxtP","recUijjVC1PfkhYnl","recmoobNLCXTqX6Hf","rec46KzzB8IhBmAYQ"],"Logo":[{"id":"attu0FH2E4ALdpVye","width":116,"height":116,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b325a23ff783351129b732dbd77561b5/c2a006dd/cryptonet.png","filename":"cryptonet.png","size":3015,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d4f84fb3b26400009ad88dfe825e1f01/37da37eb","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1911b203f0c964cf35534b6f747c1790/4d5b9d71","width":116,"height":116},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4322a205a40114f431567bbe05151870/39592f89","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Industry":["R&D"],"Blog":"https://cryptonet.org/blog","Tags":["recWBooTto1jnhJbA"],"PLGO":true,"Created":"2022-11-10","Metro Area (from Network Member Metro)":["Paris","Turin","Barcelona"],"Record ID":"recKAqkSwWVsCChiU","Number of members":4,"Tags lookup":["R&D"],"Membership Source":["PLGO Team"]}},{"id":"recKR2xb1XNCPZd6j","createdTime":"2022-11-11T21:53:46.000Z","fields":{"Name":"phas3","Short description":"phas3 is an innovation consultancy focused on Web3 technologies.","Long description":"phas3 is a consultancy focused on decentralised innovation. \n\nDecentralised innovation involves all stakeholders in decision-making.

Third Storage Cloud runs on a 'Stake to scale' payments model.","Website":"https://thirdstorage.com","Twitter":"@thirdstorage","Network members":["recMkWNvNEbOtqMlv"],"Logo":[{"id":"attyjfxgXxZLD8DVu","width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4e7b27474bae0c73ca94f40916a6571b/4e901d59/logo.png","filename":"logo.png","size":115109,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ccb44ff18410b6bf410f9ddf9a92489a/f369ff12","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e803064ee32e52984757316cd0c8c601/c1df6454","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a11ae12420b9ca5801bca724aba43558/c32862e9","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Industry":["Data Tooling","Developer Tooling","Blockchain","Decentralized Identity","Dev Ops","DeFi","Hosting","Ecosystem Growth","Payments","Software Development"],"IPFS User":true,"Filecoin User":true,"Funding Stage":"Seed","Tags":["rec8xOarXWZPzLRoB","recnRpwNQcv8d5WNh","rec6kf3Zp3srYYwuV"],"Preferred Method of Contact":"team@thirdstorage.com","Created":"2022-10-18","Metro Area (from Network Member Metro)":["Bangalore"],"Record ID":"recfGUJAEjv5RM9tK","Number of members":1,"Tags lookup":["Data Tooling","Developer Tooling","Decentralized Identity"]}},{"id":"recfLHTE12VSOlnsF","createdTime":"2022-11-10T19:19:06.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Athena DAO","Short description":"A decentralized collective to fund women’s reproductive health research & drug discovery.","Long description":"AthenaDAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a collective leveraging blockchain and crypto to fund women’s reproductive health.","Website":"https://www.athenadao.co","Twitter":"@athena_DAO_","Network members":["recQKK7421RbppRhi"],"Logo":[{"id":"attFq6T6vSuUlKiHS","width":250,"height":227,"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9594d945076bf889f3d46d2c18f62ce4/e05365e1/902520_734619.png","filename":"902520_734619.png","size":18119,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ad61b87162ea7c32d96a6dc9a4849e7e/f2424612","width":40,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1320518b9f717ce8cca4851e4e9cc5f8/93388441","width":250,"height":227},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/15000ceda8456886e68ed63329dea03f/d5700a7b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Friend of PLN":true,"Created":"2022-11-10","Metro Area (from Network Member Metro)":["Porto"],"Record ID":"recfLHTE12VSOlnsF","Number of members":1}},{"id":"recfjTmOhW4MrI3rl","createdTime":"2021-10-27T19:52:45.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Zondax","Short description":"An engineering partner for blockchain and deep tech solutions.","Long description":"Zondax is a team of software developers, engineers and cryptographers with diverse technical backgrounds that work together to build innovative tech products for companies from all kinds of industries.

Developers configure an HTTP request and can specify any part to come from on or off-chain, allowing them to access endpoints that require authentication such as Twitter or endpoints with complex responses such as Google Maps. Midpoint handles the heavy lifting of listening for requests on chain and keeping the connection to off-chain endpoints available. The entire process of sending a text, posting a tweet, or requesting off-chain data has been boiled down to one line of Solidity. \n\nToday developers are using Midpoint to interface their contracts with hundreds of traditional services including Twilio, Slack, Twitter, Salesforce, PayPal, SendGrid, Discord, DocuSign,  GitHub, Jira, and OpenAI.
